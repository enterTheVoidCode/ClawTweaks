The script automatically handles:
- Closing blocking processes
- Uninstalling previous versions
- Installing certificates and dependencies
- Installing the widget

**Silent install:** `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install.ps1 -Force`

**Troubleshooting:** If the script doesn't run, open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
.\Install.ps1
```

### Option B: Manual Install

1. Install the `.cer` certificate → Local Machine → Trusted People
2. Install dependencies from `Dependencies\x64` folder
3. Double-click the `.msixbundle` to install

### Enable the Widget

1. Open Xbox Game Bar (`Win + G`)
